Text classification is the process of classifying unstructured text data into various category such as technology, sport,medical,math etc.

Most of the information are unstructured because of the messy nature of text, this is where text classification with machine learning comes in
Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique which means that it has no labeled data and grouping a set of object having similar feature to each other.One of the most popular an simple clustering algorithms is k-means clustering algorithm.

K-Means is one of the simplest unsupervised clustering algorithm which is used to cluster our data into K number of clusters. The algorithm iteratively assigns the data points to one of the K clusters based on how near the point is to the cluster centroid.
