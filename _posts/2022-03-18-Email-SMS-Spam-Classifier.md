Spam classifier program in python which can tell whether a given message is spam or not!....I used FastAPI for an application programming interface. It helps to communicate between different programs.



We can do this by using a simple but powerful theorem from probability theory called Baye‚Äôs Theorem.

Bayes Theorem is a method to determine conditional probabilities that is, the probability of one event occurring given that another event has already occurred.

We used FastAPI for an application programming interface. It helps to communicate between different programs.

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python

pip install fastapi

pip install "uvicorn[standard]"

uvicorn main:app --reload
